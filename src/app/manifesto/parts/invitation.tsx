      <p>
        You have read the problem. You have seen the vision. You understand the
        architecture and the stance.
      </p>

      <p>Now: what will you do?</p>

      <h2>The Code Is Open</h2>

      <p>
        Everything we build is on GitHub. AGPL-licensed. You can read it, run it,
        fork it, improve it. If you see something broken, fix it. If you see
        something missing, build it.
      </p>

      <p>The infrastructure belongs to everyone willing to contribute.</p>

      <h2>The Principles Are Public</h2>

      <p>
        This document is not internal strategy. It is a public commitment. Hold us
        to it. If we drift from these principles, call it out. The evidence base is
        public too—every claim is sourced.
      </p>

      <p>The mission is bigger than any organization, including this one.</p>

      <h2>The Mission Belongs to Anyone Who Shares It</h2>

      <p>
        You do not need permission to join. You do not need to be hired, funded, or
        approved.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you believe that human contribution should be the foundation of economic
        value. If you believe that what you create belongs to you. If you believe
        that knowledge should be free to use but never free of its history.
      </p>

      <p>Then you are already part of this.</p>

      <p>
        Build with us. Build alongside us. Build something better and prove us
        wrong. The goal is not that DreamTree wins. The goal is that the
        contribution economy exists.
      </p>

      <h2>The Moment</h2>

      <p>
        The attention economy is exhausted. Regulation is arriving. The technical
        infrastructure is ready. The cultural demand for fairness has never been
        stronger.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a moment that will last forever. The choices made now by
        builders, by institutions, by policymakers will shape the next generation
        of digital infrastructure.
      </p>

        The world takes care of those who take care of the world. Not always. Not
        immediately. But often enough to bet on.
      </p>

      <p>We are making that bet.</p>
