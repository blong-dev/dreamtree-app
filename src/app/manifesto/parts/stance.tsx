        Vision and architecture mean nothing without integrity in execution. This
        part explains how we organize ourselves and why.
      </p>

      <h2>Not Nonprofit</h2>

      <p>
        The obvious question: if the mission is about human flourishing and not
        extraction, why not structure as a nonprofit?
      </p>

      <p>
        We considered it. Nonprofits have tax advantages. They signal mission
        purity. They attract grants and donors who want to support good work.
      </p>

      <p>
        But nonprofits have constraints that conflict with our goals. Spending
        flexibility is limited. Boards can drift from founder intent. Donor
        influence becomes donor control. The same problem as venture capital, loss
        of sovereignty, dressed in different clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        This critique is not absolute. Khan Academy, Wikipedia, and Mozilla have
        maintained mission alignment at scale as nonprofits or foundations. The
        model can work. But it requires constant vigilance against board capture and
        donor dependence. We want a structure where alignment is built in, not
        continually defended.
      </p>

      <p>So: not nonprofit.</p>

      <h2>Not Extractive</h2>

      <p>
        The alternative trap is conventional venture-backed startup logic. Raise
        money, capture market, extract value, exit. The incentives are clear: growth
        metrics over mission, shareholder returns over user benefit, exit over
        endurance.
      </p>

      <p>We reject this too.</p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to build a company that gets acquired. The goal is to build
        infrastructure that outlasts us. Infrastructure does not have exits. It has
        stewards.
      </p>

      <p>So: not extractive.</p>

      <h2>Steward-Ownership</h2>

      <p>There is a third path.</p>

      <p>
        Steward-ownership is a legal and governance structure designed for
        mission-driven companies that want to remain independent indefinitely. The
        model comes from the Purpose Foundation, which has worked with over 300
        companies, and a growing ecosystem that includes Ecosia, Sharetribe, and
        Patagonia. Through Holdfast Collective, Patagonia has already directed $4.6
        million to create the Vjosa River national park in Albania—profit serving
        planet, as promised.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not an untested model. In Denmark, steward-owned companies represent
        approximately 60% of the Copenhagen stock market&apos;s value. Novo Nordisk,
        one of the world&apos;s most valuable companies, is controlled by the Novo
        Nordisk Foundation. Carlsberg has been foundation-owned since 1888. Research
        shows Danish steward-owned companies have a 6x higher survival probability
        after 40 years compared to conventional peers—more resilient, more
        innovative, and equally profitable.
      </p>

      <p>The core principles:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Profits stay in the mission.</strong> The company can be
          profitable, pay fair wages, reinvest in growth. But profits cannot be
          extracted by owners beyond reasonable compensation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No sale to extractive buyers.</strong> The company cannot be sold
          to someone who would strip it for parts or pivot away from the mission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Control stays with stewards.</strong> Voting rights remain with
          people committed to the mission, not with whoever holds the most shares.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This structure has tradeoffs. Steward-owned companies cannot raise equity
        capital by design. This constrains growth speed and limits R&D investment.
        For infrastructure at civilizational scale, this may be a binding
        constraint. We accept the tradeoff because the alternative, ceding control
        to investors who may not share the mission, is worse. Slow alignment beats
        fast drift.
      </p>

      <p>
        We cannot be acquired. This is usually framed as a constraint, but for
        infrastructure builders it is a strategic asset. Ecosystem partners can
        build on our systems knowing they will not be sold to a competitor.
        Contributors can trust that their verified credentials will exist in a
        decade. The inability to exit signals permanence, and permanence attracts
        the long-term partnerships that infrastructure requires.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end goal, eventually: give the company to the planet. A cooperative
        structure where users and contributors share ownership of the infrastructure
        they helped build. Cooperatives face their own challenges: free-rider
        problems, decision paralysis, capital constraints. We do not have a complete
        governance design. What we have is a commitment to stewardship over
        extraction, with the intention to distribute ownership as we learn what
        works.
      </p>

      <p>We know this is the difficult path. It is also the right path.</p>

      <h2>Why We Don&apos;t Dictate</h2>

      <p>
        Part III acknowledged that compensation is unsolved. This is not an
        oversight. It is a refusal.
      </p>

      <p>
        A founder dictating the compensation mechanism would replicate the
        extraction problem at a different layer. The whole critique of surveillance
        capitalism is that a small number of actors made decisions about value
        distribution without the consent of those whose value was being distributed.
        We will not repeat that pattern by decreeing how contributors should be
        paid.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are collective decisions. They require deliberation, contestation, and
        legitimacy that no founder—however well-intentioned—can provide alone. You
        cannot have a legitimate answer to &quot;how should contributors be
        paid?&quot; without first answering &quot;who decides?&quot; The governance
        infrastructure must exist before the compensation mechanism can be decided.
      </p>

      <p>We are early. There is work to do.</p>

      <p>
        This is the purpose of DreamTree&apos;s profitability. Not personal
        enrichment. Not growth for its own sake. Revenue funds the creation of
        deliberative infrastructure: the forums, processes, and institutions through
        which these collective decisions can be made. We will fund the forums,
        moderate the debates, and implement what emerges—but we will not
        predetermine the outcome. We are building the preconditions for a debate we
        refuse to foreclose.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contribution economy cannot be designed by one person and a swarm of
        AIs. It must be argued into existence by the people who will live in it.
      </p>

      <h2>Open Source, Copyleft</h2>

      <p>The code is open. License: AGPL-3.0.</p>

      <p>
        Why AGPL specifically? Because it is copyleft with teeth. If you use our
        code to build a service, you must share your modifications. This prevents
        the common exploitation pattern: take open-source work, build proprietary
        product on top, capture the value, give nothing back.
      </p>

      <p>
        This choice has costs. AGPL discourages commercial adoption. Many
        enterprises refuse to integrate AGPL-licensed code because the copyleft
        requirement conflicts with their proprietary strategies. If our flywheel
        depends on enterprise demand, this creates friction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our answer: the core infrastructure should remain open, but we can provide
        alternative licensing for specific enterprise use cases where AGPL creates
        genuine obstacles. Dual licensing is established practice. The principle is
        that the commons remains common; the accommodation is that not every use
        case fits neatly into copyleft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open source is not charity. It is strategy. It builds trust. It invites
        contribution. It makes the code more robust through many eyes. And it
        ensures that even if this organization fails, the work survives. The
        infrastructure belongs to everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Movement, Not Empire</h2>

      <p>
        The data sovereignty movement exists. MyData Global has a declaration
        translated into 13 languages that influenced the Finnish Government
        Programme and the European Data Strategy. The Solid Project, led by Tim
        Berners-Lee, has built infrastructure for personal data stores. Verifiable
        Credentials have a W3C standard. AT Protocol has a growing ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are not the first to care about these problems. We do not need to
        reinvent every wheel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our stance: join the movement, don&apos;t dominate it. Adopt existing
        standards where they fit. Contribute to standards where they fall short.
        Build relationships with aligned organizations. Speak at their conferences.
        Publish in their channels. Become a champion for ideas bigger than
        ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        What happens when existing standards conflict with our vision? We adapt
        where we can. We propose changes where we cannot. We do not fork lightly,
        but we also do not compromise core principles for compatibility. This is a
        judgment call, made repeatedly, in context.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ego move is to build everything from scratch, claim credit, capture the
        space. The strategic move is to strengthen the ecosystem that strengthens
        us.
      </p>

      <h2>Bootstrap</h2>

      <p>We are not raising venture capital.</p>

      <p>
        VC money comes with expectations: rapid growth, market capture, exit. Those
        expectations shape every decision, often invisibly. The board seat that
        seemed harmless becomes the lever that redirects the mission. The growth
        metric that seemed neutral becomes the target that corrupts the product.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bootstrap means slower growth. It means saying no to opportunities that
        require scale we cannot afford. It means profitability matters from the
        start, not as a post-IPO afterthought.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also means freedom. Freedom to prioritize users over metrics. Freedom to
        build for decades, not quarters. Freedom to remain aligned with the mission
        because no one else is in the room demanding otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mission-driven companies attract talent that conventional companies cannot.
        Patagonia reports 4% annual turnover—three times lower than the retail
        industry average—and receives 9,000 applicants for each open position.
        Research shows organizations with engaged, purpose-aligned employees
        outperform competitors by 147% in earnings per share. The decision to
        prioritize mission over exit is not merely principled. It is a talent
        strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The revenue model: institutions pay. High schools, community colleges,
        bootcamps, career centers, workforce development boards. These organizations
        have budgets for career services. They need outcomes they can measure and
        report. DreamTree provides both: a tool that users value and data that
        institutions can use to demonstrate effectiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pricing is per-seat or per-institution, depending on scale. One contract
        serves hundreds of users. Retention is structural: institutions do not churn
        the way individual consumers do. Business-to-business sustains the mission.
        Free access is the mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a complete business plan. It is a sketch. We will learn from
        customers what they value and price accordingly. What we commit to is the
        model: institutional revenue subsidizes free access.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        This is who we are. Not nonprofit, not extractive. Steward-owned,
        open-source, movement-aligned, bootstrapped. Choosing the difficult path
        because the easy paths lead somewhere else.
